    (p "Ricardo urged the audience of wet lab scientists and bioinformaticians
to apply the same rigorous standards of experimental design to
experiments involving software: all variables need to be captured and
constrained.  To demonstrate that this does not need to be complicated,
Ricardo reported the experiences of the Akalin lab in building a
collection of reproducibly built automated genomics workflows using GNU
Guix.")
