Guix-HPC an effort to optimize [GNU Guix](https://gnu.org/s/guix) for
_reproducible scientific workflows in high-performance computing_ (HPC).
Our [introductory article](/guix-hpc-debut.html) explains how we got
started and gives an overview of what we want to achieve.  We will
regularly publish articles on this Web site highlighting specific
features or achievements.  Stay tuned!

Guix-HPC is a joint software development project currently involving
three research institutes: [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en),
the
[Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC)](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/),
and the [Utrecht Bioinformatics Center (UBC)](https://ubc.uu.nl/).

If you are using Guix in an HPC context at your workplace, or if you
would like to find ways to address your own HPC use cases, or if you are
an HPC vendor interested in improving the software deployment experience
for your users, please consider joining us!  Email us at
